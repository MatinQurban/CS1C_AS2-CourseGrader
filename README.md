Write a program to model courses with students and grades. Here are the requirements:

1. A course has an instructor, name and description (e.g. Homi Bodhanwala, CS 1C, Intro to Computer Science III).

2. Each course contains several students and assignments.

3. A course supports:

- a) Printing the student roster (names and id numbers of the students)

- b) Printing the assignment list (names and descriptions of assignments)

- c) Displaying the final grades of each student (student id, student name, letter grade)

4. Assignments have a name, description, and total points possible.

5. Students have a name, student id, and grades for each assignment in the class.

6. A student supports:

a) Print the student details

b)Returning the student's letter grade. You can find the student's total earned points and divide it by the number of total points allowed and then convert that percentage to a letter grade.

7. Note you may need several other behaviors (functions). Create what you need and think about when the function should be public or private.

Use the above requirements to write the program. The requirements may have some ambiguities, but that is OK. Write a program that correctly solves the problem. If you make necessary assumptions, comment your code.
